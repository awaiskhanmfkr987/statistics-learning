<h2>📘 Learn Statistics – Concepts, Definitions & Explanations</h2>

<!-- ================= DESCRIPTIVE ================= -->
<h3>1. Descriptive Statistics</h3>

<p>
<b>Descriptive Statistics</b> are used to summarize, organize, and describe the main features of a dataset.
They do not make predictions or generalizations beyond the data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mean:</b> The arithmetic average of all observations. It represents the central value of the data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Median:</b> The middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is robust to outliers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Variance:</b> Measures how far observations spread from the mean by averaging squared deviations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Standard Deviation:</b> The square root of variance. It indicates the average distance of observations from the mean.
</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= PARAMETRIC ================= -->
<h3>2. Parametric Tests</h3>

<p>
<b>Parametric tests</b> are statistical tests that assume the data follows a specific distribution,
usually the normal distribution, and that the data is measured on an interval or ratio scale.
</p>

<p>
<b>One-Sample t-Test:</b><br>
This test is used to determine whether the mean of a single sample is significantly different
from a known or hypothesized population mean.
</p>

<p>
<b>Independent t-Test:</b><br>
This test compares the means of two independent groups to determine whether there is a statistically
significant difference between them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Paired t-Test:</b><br>
This test compares two related measurements taken from the same individuals, such as before and after treatment.
</p>

<p>
<b>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):</b><br>
ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine whether at least one group
mean differs significantly from the others.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pearson Correlation:</b><br>
This test measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.
The correlation coefficient ranges from −1 to +1.
</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= NON-PARAMETRIC ================= -->
<h3>3. Non-Parametric Tests</h3>

<p>
<b>Non-parametric tests</b> do not require assumptions of normality and are suitable for ordinal data,
skewed distributions, or small sample sizes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mann–Whitney U Test:</b><br>
This test is a non-parametric alternative to the independent t-test and compares the distributions of two independent groups using ranks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test:</b><br>
This test is the non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test and is used when the differences between paired observations
are not normally distributed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Kruskal–Wallis Test:</b><br>
This test extends the Mann–Whitney U test to more than two groups and serves as a non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA.
</p>

<p>
<b>Spearman Rank Correlation:</b><br>
This test measures the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables using ranked data.
</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= CATEGORICAL ================= -->
<h3>4. Categorical / Distribution Tests</h3>

<p>
These tests are used for categorical data or to examine whether data follows a specific probability distribution.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chi-Square Test:</b><br>
This test examines whether there is a significant association or independence between two categorical variables.
</p>

<p>
<b>Binomial Test:</b><br>
This test evaluates whether the observed proportion of successes differs significantly from a theoretical proportion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sign Test:</b><br>
This non-parametric test evaluates whether the median of a population differs from a specified value using only the direction of differences.
</p>

<p>
<b>Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test:</b><br>
This test compares an observed distribution with a theoretical distribution to determine whether they differ significantly.
</p>
