<h2>📘 Learn Advanced Statistics – Concepts & Definitions</h2>

<!-- ================= Z-TESTS ================= -->
<h3>1. Z-Tests</h3>
<p>Used primarily for large sample sizes (n>30) or when the population variance is known.</p>

<p><b>One-Sample Z-Test:</b> Compares a sample mean to a known population mean to determine if there is a significant difference.</p>

<p><b>Two-Sample Z-Test:</b> Compares the means of two independent samples to determine whether they differ significantly.</p>

<p><b>Z-Proportion Test:</b> Compares the population proportions to test if they differ from each other.</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= STUDENT’S T-TESTS ================= -->
<h3>2. Student’s T-Tests</h3>
<p>Used for smaller sample sizes or when the population variance is unknown.</p>

<p><b>One-Sample T-Test:</b> Compares a sample mean to a hypothesized value.</p>

<p><b>Independent (Two-Sample) T-Test:</b> Compares the means of two distinct independent groups.</p>

<p><b>Paired (Dependent) T-Test:</b> Compares means from the same group measured at different times or under different conditions.</p>

<p><b>Welch’s T-Test:</b> A variation of the independent t-test used when equal variance assumption (homoscedasticity) is violated.</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= ANOVA ================= -->
<h3>3. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</h3>
<p>Used to compare the means of three or more groups.</p>

<p><b>One-Way ANOVA:</b> Compares means across three or more groups based on one factor.</p>

<p><b>Two-Way ANOVA:</b> Compares means based on two independent factors and examines interaction between them.</p>

<p><b>Repeated Measures ANOVA:</b> Used when the same subjects are measured multiple times under different conditions.</p>

<p><b>MANOVA (Multivariate ANOVA):</b> Extension of ANOVA for multiple dependent variables.</p>

<p><b>ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance):</b> Combines ANOVA and regression to control for effects of continuous covariates.</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= CORRELATION & REGRESSION ================= -->
<h3>4. Correlation and Regression</h3>

<p><b>Pearson’s Correlation (r):</b> Measures strength and direction of linear relationship between two continuous variables.</p>

<p><b>Linear Regression:</b> Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables; can be used for prediction and interpretation of associations.</p>

<hr>

<!-- ================= OTHER PARAMETRIC TESTS ================= -->
<h3>5. Other Parametric Tests</h3>

<p><b>F-Test:</b> Used to compare variances of two populations; also forms the basis for ANOVA.</p>

<p><b>Chow Test:</b> Used in econometrics to determine if coefficients in two linear regressions on different datasets are equal.</p>

<hr>

<h3>🎯 Summary</h3>
<p>
This page provides detailed conceptual understanding of advanced parametric tests including <b>Z-tests, T-tests, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and other parametric methods</b>.  
It explains <b>when to use each test, assumptions required, and the key purpose</b>.
